## 2022-2023 INITIATIVES

#### Connecticut Tech Talent

#### Accelerator (CT TTA)

In 2021, The New England Board
of Higher Education (NEBHE) and
the Business-Higher Education
Forum (BHEF) were designated by
the Connecticut Office of Workforce
Strategy (OWS) to direct a higher
education innovation challenge: The
Connecticut Higher Education Tech
Talent Accelerator (TTA). Through
the state’s initial investment in TTA,
seven partnerships between business
and higher education institutions
have been built. As a result, new pro-
grams and credentials are available
to Connecticut’s workers in fields
like cybersecurity, mobile applica-
tion development and game develop-
ment. With an additional investment
from the state, TTA will increase its
cohort of grantees, and support up
to 13 partnerships to increase access
to credential pathways leading to
in-demand tech jobs and strengthen
collaboration between business and
higher education institutions.

#### Open Education

```
Open Educational Resources (OER)
are free teaching and learning
resources with a license that allows
for reproduction, redistribution,
and adaptation in perpetuity. NEB-
HE launched its Open Education
initiative in 2019 with the generous
support of the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation. Building on
the success of this grant, the Wil-
liam and Flora Hewlett Foundation
awarded a second two-year grant in
2023, through which NEBHE will
provide resources, infrastructure,
and research to guide course mark-
ing initiatives and policies. Selected
institutions will implement course
marking, participate in a yearlong
community of practice and have
access to topical OER consulting ser-
vices. Grantees include Johnson &
Wales University (RI), New England
College (NH), St. John Fisher Uni-
versity (NY), and Thomas College
(ME).
```
#### Economic Impact Briefs

```
In partnership with the New En-
gland Council, NEBHE’s Policy &
Research team developed a series
of one-page briefs demonstrating
the impact of higher education
for each New England state and
regionally. Indicators included
student enrollment, Pell Grant
recipients and jobs created in the
last year and were used at NEC’s
annual Washington Leaders Con-
ference to advocate for increased
federal funding for higher educa-
tion in New England.

#### Legislative Advisory

#### Committee

Legislative Advisory Committee
(LAC) membership is comprised of
legislative delegates to the NEBHE
Board and additional sitting legisla-
tors from each state with an inter-
est in higher education. NEBHE
convenes the LAC semi-annually to
strengthen state higher education
policymaking in New England, pro-
mote regional dialogue and greater
interstate collaboration, and inform
NEBHE’s policy analysis, research
and program activities. Recent LAC
meetings have included discussions
on transcript and registration hold
policies, community college student
success, and higher education in
prison.

#### Strategic Planning

```
As a certified strategic planner,
Katie Singer has led NEBHE’s 2023-
2027 strategic planning process
since July 2022. The process has in-
cluded information gathering about
high-priority issues in higher edu-
cation from NEBHE’s stakeholders,
including its Board of Delegates, as
well as two multi-day staff retreats.
To date, NEBHE has revamped its
mission statement, developed a
vision statement and three strategic
priorities to guide its work for the
next five years. NEBHE’s 2023-
strategic pillars are affordability/
financial sustainability, equity and
education-workforce alignment.

#### New England Commission

#### on the Future of Higher

#### Education in Prison

```
From October 2022 – June 2023,
the New England Commission on
the Future of Higher Education in
Prison (“the Commission”) was a
key initiative of NEBHE and The
Educational Justice Institute at MIT
(TEJI) chaired by Drs. Lee Perl-
man and Michael K. Thomas. The
Commission’s 83 members worked
to develop 15 recommendations
to align institutions, policymakers,
corrections and industry to increase
the academic, socioemotional and
career readiness of system-involved
people—and facilitate successful
transitions to work and sustained
contributions to the well-being of
the region and nation.
