# Policy and Research

## Introduction

_NEBHE's Policy & Research team seeks to support innovation, engage in conversations, and drive change by providing timely information, research, and analysis on issues related to higher education and workforce development to decision-makers and the public throughout New England. NEBHE works closely with the New England states to improve higher education across the region. Click [here](https://nebhe.org/about-nebhe/our-membership/) to explore information about each of our six states. New England is home to more than 250 postsecondary institutions — a rich array of public and independent two- and four-year colleges and universities whose locations, programs, and services seek to meet the needs of all New Englanders, as well as attract others from across the country and around the world._

#### Mission

NEBHE's Policy & Research team informs leaders in higher education and government through research, policy analysis, planning, and capacity building.

#### Vision

We are the go-to resource in New England and beyond for data-informed analysis and expertise in higher education issues.

## 2022-2023 INITIATIVES

#### Connecticut Tech Talent Accelerator (CT TTA)

In 2021, The New England Board of Higher Education (NEBHE) and the Business-Higher Education Forum (BHEF) were designated by the Connecticut Office of Workforce Strategy (OWS) to direct a higher education innovation challenge: The Connecticut Higher Education Tech Talent Accelerator (TTA). Through the state's initial investment in TTA, seven partnerships between business and higher education institutions have been built. As a result, new programs and credentials are available to Connecticut's workers in fields like [cybersecurity](https://nebhe.org/connecticut-tta), [mobile application development](https://nebhe.org/connecticut-tta), and [game development](https://nebhe.org/connecticut-tta). With an additional investment from the state, TTA will increase its cohort of grantees, and support up to 13 partnerships to increase access to credential pathways leading to in-demand tech jobs and strengthen collaboration between business and higher education institutions.

#### Open Education

Open Educational Resources (OER) are free teaching and learning resources with a license that allows for reproduction, redistribution, and adaptation in perpetuity. NEBHE launched its Open Education initiative in 2019 with the generous support of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Building on the success of this grant, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation awarded a second two-year grant in 2023, through which NEBHE will provide resources, infrastructure, and research to guide course marking initiatives and policies. Selected institutions will implement course marking, participate in a yearlong community of practice, and have access to topical OER consulting services. Grantees include [Johnson & Wales University (RI)](https://nebhe.org/oer), [New England College (NH)](https://nebhe.org/oer), [St. John Fisher University (NY)](https://nebhe.org/oer), and [Thomas College (ME)](https://nebhe.org/oer).

#### Economic Impact Briefs

In partnership with the New England Council, NEBHE's Policy & Research team developed a series of one-page briefs demonstrating the impact of higher education for each New England state and regionally. Indicators included student enrollment, Pell Grant recipients, and jobs created in the last year and were used at NEC's annual Washington Leaders Conference to advocate for increased federal funding for higher education in New England.

#### Legislative Advisory Committee (LAC)

Legislative Advisory Committee (LAC) membership is comprised of legislative delegates to the NEBHE Board and additional sitting legislators from each state with an interest in higher education. NEBHE convenes the LAC semi-annually to strengthen state higher education policymaking in New England, promote regional dialogue and greater interstate collaboration, and inform NEBHE's policy analysis, research, and program activities. Recent LAC meetings have included discussions on transcript and registration hold policies, community college student success, and higher education in prison. [Learn more](https://nebhe.org/lac)

#### Strategic Planning

As a certified strategic planner, Katie Singer has led NEBHE's 2023-2027 strategic planning process since July 2022. The process has included information gathering about high-priority issues in higher education from NEBHE's stakeholders, including its Board of Delegates, as well as two multi-day staff retreats. To date, NEBHE has revamped its mission statement, developed a vision statement, and three strategic priorities to guide its work for the next five years. NEBHE's 2023-strategic pillars are affordability/financial sustainability, equity, and education-workforce alignment. [Learn more](https://nebhe.org/newslink/spring-2022-new-leadership/)

#### New England Commission on the Future of Higher Education in Prison

From October 2022 – June 2023, the New England Commission on the Future of Higher Education in Prison ("the Commission") was a key initiative of NEBHE and The Educational Justice Institute at MIT (TEJI) chaired by Drs. Lee Perlman and Michael K. Thomas. The Commission's 83 members worked to develop 15 recommendations to align institutions, policymakers, corrections, and industry to increase the academic, socioemotional, and career readiness of system-involved people—and facilitate successful transitions to work and sustained contributions to the well-being of the region and nation.
